mismatch between database column name "location" and form label "zip code"
  should column be renamed?
  should users input zip code but save city string in database?
    this makes sense because we only want to convert the zip to a city once, and not every time a user is rendered
  should there be columns for zip AND city?
    this might make sense for yelp if they want to track statistics this way, but probably not for this project
