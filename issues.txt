how to not show a validation error (only want to show zip code error, not location)

for search results, should the backbone router narrow down the business listings?
  so, I could iterate through the collection, but it's better to do this search at the db level
  I want all businesses where the name (for now) matches the search term
    where search_term is in business.name
  render these as json in rails api
  how to get the search term from backbone to rails?
    FORM
  form posts to api/search
